This project is currently in a proof-of-concept state, showing a mostly working
ffmpeg integration and a basic headless camera set-up.

Things are working but please be aware that not all of the privacy and security
policies are implemented to properly secure the solution.  For example, both
HTTP basic authentication and unencrypted video transmission are used which are
of course both vulnerable to severe man-in-the-middle attacks.
